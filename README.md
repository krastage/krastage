# Hello, my name is Marat!

### About Me:

I am a novice web developer.  
My journey into IT began with technical support at "Geonavigation LLC", where I worked for about 1.5 years. However, I didn't stop there and started delving into programming languages.  
The first truly serious language I encountered was Java, and I worked with the IntelliJ IDEA development environment. During my learning process, I became familiar with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) as well as important methodologies like SOLID, DRY, and KISS. With this knowledge, I got a job and worked for some time at "NAUMEN", also providing product support, but later decided to make a 360-degree shift in my technological stack.  
My further goal was to learn frontend development. I studied the basic syntax of HTML markup, CSS styles, and also got acquainted with BEM and the Webpack project bundler. Currently, I am developing websites of various complexity levels. My projects involve the use of HTML, CSS (including SCSS and SASS), JavaScript (or TypeScript) in conjunction with the React library or Vanilla JS. I use npm and yarn as tools for managing dependencies and project building.
